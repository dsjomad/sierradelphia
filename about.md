In the summer of 2020 we sold our house in a college town and purchased 10 acres in the Texas countryside.
We moved into an RV with 6 of our children and started gardening, raising chickens and honey bees!

We are a homeschooling family so farm activity was added to our list of homeschool subjects.

Join us in our adventure building our Texas Homestead.
