Welcome to our video diary from September 2020 to present day chronicling the building of our Texas Homestead.

December 2020 ... got tired of living in the RV so we picked up a 16 x 50 unfinished barn style cabin.  Our friend Thomas is helping us finish it out so we can move into it until we can build our permanent home.
