Welcome to our video diary from September 2020 to present day chronicling the building of our Texas Homestead.

Family introduction. Jennifer, Daniel, Jimmy, Voula, Michael, Eliana and Ephraimia taking a lunch break.
Synopsis of the first 6 weeks given by Jennifer. At this point we are still adjusting to downsizing from a 2700 sq ft house in town to living in an 32 foot RV.

Excited about getting a septic tank and finishing our chicken coop!

Shaky camera and getting used to video taping. Lot's of room for improvement.
