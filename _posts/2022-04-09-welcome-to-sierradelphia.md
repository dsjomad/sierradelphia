Welcome!

Our blog begins with a move to the Washington County countryside in 2020.

We sold our house that we owned in College Station for 15 years and bought 10 acres of cleared land.

We thought that living in an RV until we could build our permanent home would be a good idea.

That lasted less than 6 months. We purchased a little cabin and finished it out.

Join us on our adventure to building our homestead.
